# react-typescript-RPC

npm install

npm start

To run few selected tests run:

npm test

With more time I would have:

- Create a more comprehensive test suite. Have added a few tests just to illustrate.
- Added the totals section (i.e. total losses and wins)
- More attentions to the animation transitions.
- More attention to the text fonts, that might not be as per spec.
- More attention to exact pixel positioning and lengths/sizes as per spec.
